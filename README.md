# cron_chstu
This application was created for students and teachers, on Ekreative hackathon(2017). This is an assistant who can check your progress in delivering laboratory work to each subject during the semester.
It can notificate :
- when you have debts 
- how much labs you should pass
- how much labs you passed
### The project has some problems, it can't be started, because the calendar bot does not work. Perhaps we will fix it in the future :-)
